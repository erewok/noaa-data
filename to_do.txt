pull:
Lat + Lon from: H1 tags
Use that to get tabular forecase data
set class.attribute: lat and lon (weather.lat), (weather.lon)
forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=LAT&_NEG_lon&unit=0&lg=english&FcstType=digital
##IMPORTANT: Long is set to negative on west coast, check full url for details elsewhere


# ----------------------------------- #
# STEPS used by program to generate data
# 1. Build NoaaParser object "Weather"
# 2. top_level = Weather.parse_results(url_source)
# 3. Select Region (new url)
# 4. second_level = weather.parse_results(selected_region_url)
# 5. Find search key within region
# 6. my_loc = weather.get_locations(search-key, second_level)
# 7. my_weather = weather.weather_get(my_loc)
# ------------------------------------- #


TO DO: 
Build interactive prompt to find content user wants to see/save.
Set-up Automatic emailing of results (cron)
Fix unicode encoding on SMS received
Change data pulled by NoaaParser.weather_get so it is more logical. (in progress...)
Test against other ndbc.noaa.gov pages
Test location-search against various values and build more logical location-selector
Build config-file generator.


Record-Keeping:
Output to csv desired results from selected stations
